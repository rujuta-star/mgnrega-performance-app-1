I’ve already built an MVP for my MGNREGA District Performance Dashboard at this Replit project.

Please review my current code and update it **only if any of the following required features or resilience improvements are missing.**
Do not remove existing working logic — just enhance or extend it.

✅ Features that must exist (add or improve if not already implemented):

1. **Data Source & Reliability**
   - Fetch data from the official data.gov.in MGNREGA API.
   - Handle cases where the API may be down, throttled, or return incomplete data for certain districts.
   - Maintain a static list of all districts for the chosen state (e.g., Maharashtra) so that even if API data for some districts is missing, the UI still displays them with a message like “Data unavailable – showing last updated data.”
   - Cache API responses locally (in a JSON file or lightweight database like SQLite) so that the app continues working even when the API is slow, down, or returns partial data.

2. **Historical & Comparative Insights**
   - Include data for multiple months and years to show both **current and past performance.**
   - Allow comparison between multiple districts in the chosen state (side-by-side view).
   - Add visualizations for **year-over-year** or **month-over-month** trends using charts.

3. **Offline & Accessibility**
   - Implement **Progressive Web App (PWA)** features for offline functionality so that cached data remains accessible.
   - Add **text-to-speech (TTS)** explanations in **Marathi** using the Web Speech API — when a user selects a district, read out key metrics in Marathi for low-literacy users.
   - Keep the interface **simple, bilingual (English + Marathi)**, and suitable for rural audiences.

4. **Reporting & Data Export**
   - Add export options for **PDF** and **CSV** so local officials or citizens can download district reports easily.

5. **Technical Architecture**
   - Include retry logic and graceful error handling for API failures or rate limits.
   - Structure code modularly with clear comments and reusable functions.
   - At the top of the code, include a short summary of which features or improvements you added.

🧩 Bonus:
If possible, implement a feature that automatically detects the user’s district from their geolocation (for example, using browser geolocation + district mapping) and loads that district’s data by default.

**Instructions:**  
Only modify what’s needed — keep existing working logic intact, add missing resilience features, and ensure the system is **production-ready** for large-scale use across India.
